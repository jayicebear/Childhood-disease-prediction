# Childhood-disease-prediction

Find out the child disease through using children game data.

I found out top 5 events occured among the plays which signifies the behavior characteristics of the game players. 
Latent dirichlet Allocation(LDA) analysis the time flow of the five most frequent events of the children. 
LDA also helpd me to look up words with the biggest differences in topics.

Through using these time flow of the most frequent behaviors from the game,
I concluded that specific diseases are related to the specific serieses of actions of children.
